## üöÄ Crawl4AI 0.4.2 Update: Smarter Crawling Just Got Easier (Dec 12, 2024)

## Description

I‚Äôm excited to share Crawl4AI 0.4.2‚Äîa major upgrade that makes crawling smarter, faster, and a whole lot more intuitive. I‚Äôve packed in a bunch of new features to simplify your workflows and improve your experience. Let‚Äôs cut to the chase!

You‚Äôve asked for better control over how browsers and crawlers are configured, and now you‚Äôve got it. With the new BrowserConfig and CrawlerRunConfig objects, you can set up your browser and crawling behavior exactly how you want. No more cluttering arun with a dozen arguments‚Äîjust pass in your configs and go.

Example:

This setup is a game-changer for scalability, keeping your code clean and flexible as we add more parameters in the future.

Remember: If you like to use the old way, you can still pass arguments directly to arun as before, no worries!

Here‚Äôs the big one: You can now pass local storage and cookies directly. Whether it‚Äôs setting values programmatically or importing a saved JSON state, managing sessions has never been easier. This is a must-have for authenticated crawls‚Äîjust export your storage state once and reuse it effortlessly across runs.

Example:
1. Open a browser, log in manually, and export the storage state.
2. Import the JSON file for seamless authenticated crawling:

Two big upgrades here:

Blazing-fast long-page screenshots: Turn extremely long web pages into clean, high-quality screenshots‚Äîwithout breaking a sweat. It‚Äôs optimized to handle large content without lag.

Full-page PDF exports: Now, you can also convert any page into a PDF with all the details intact. Perfect for archiving or sharing complex layouts.

1.‚ÄÄAuthenticated Crawls: Login once, export your storage state, and reuse it across multiple requests without the headache.
2.‚ÄÄLong-page Screenshots: Perfect for blogs, e-commerce pages, or any endless-scroll website.
3.‚ÄÄPDF Export: Create professional-looking page PDFs in seconds.

Crawl4AI 0.4.2 is ready for you to download and try. I‚Äôm always looking for ways to improve, so don‚Äôt hold back‚Äîshare your thoughts and feedback.

Happy Crawling! üöÄ
