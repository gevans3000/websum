The Browser Use Cloud API lets you create and manage browser automation agents programmatically. Each agent can execute tasks and provide real-time feedback through a live preview URL.
​ [18]
Prerequisites
You need an active subscription and an API key from cloud.browser-use.com/billing [19]
​ [20]
Pricing
The Browser Use Cloud API is priced at $0.05 per step that agent executes.
Since Browser Use has the ability to execute multiple steps at the same time, the price for filling out forms much lower than other services.
​ [21]
Creating Your First Agent
Create a new browser automation task by providing instructions in natural language:

The API returns a task ID that you can use to manage the task and check the live preview URL.
The task response includes a that you can embed in an iframe to watch and control the agent in real-time.
​ [22]
Managing Tasks
Control running tasks with these operations:
Pause/Resume Tasks
Temporarily pause task execution with [](https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/</cloud/api-v1/pause-task>) and resume with [](https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/</cloud/api-v1/resume-task>). Useful for manual inspection or intervention.
Stop Tasks
Permanently stop a task using [](https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/</cloud/api-v1/stop-task>). The task cannot be resumed after being stopped.
For detailed API documentation, see the tabs on the left, which includes the full coverage of the API.

Building your own client (OpenAPI)
We recommend this only if you don’t need control and only need to run simple tasks.
The best way to build your own client is to use our OpenAPI specification [24] to generate a type-safe client library.
​ [25]
Python
Use to generate a modern Python client:
Copy

---

This will create a Python package with full type hints, modern dataclasses, and async support.
​ [26]
TypeScript/JavaScript
For TypeScript projects, use to generate type definitions:
Copy

---

This will create TypeScript definitions that you can use with your preferred HTTP client.
