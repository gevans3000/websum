Overview
The class is the core component of Browser Use that handles browser automation. Here are the main configuration options you can use when initializing an agent.
​ [20]
Basic Settings
Copy

---

​ [21]
Required Parameters
 : The instruction for the agent to execute
 : A LangChain chat model instance. See LangChain Models [22] for supported models.

---

​ [23]
Agent Behavior
Control how the agent operates:
Copy

---

​ [24]
Behavior Parameters
 : Registry of functions the agent can call. Defaults to base Controller. See Custom Functions [25] for details.
 : Enable/disable vision capabilities. Defaults to . 
 When enabled, the model processes visual information from web pages
 Disable to reduce costs or use models without vision support
 For GPT-4o, image processing costs approximately 800-1000 tokens (~$0.002 USD) per image (but this depends on the defined screen size)
 : Path to save the complete conversation history. Useful for debugging.
 : Custom system prompt class. See System Prompt [26] for customization options.

---

Vision capabilities are recommended for better web interaction understanding, but can be disabled to reduce costs or when using models without vision support.
​ [27]
(Reuse) Browser Configuration
You can configure how the agent interacts with the browser. To see more options refer to the Browser Settings [28] documentation.
​ [29]
Reuse Existing Browser
: A Browser Use Browser instance. When provided, the agent will reuse this browser instance and automatically create new contexts for each .
Copy

---

Remember: in this scenario the will not be closed automatically.
​ [30]
Reuse Existing Browser Context
: A Playwright browser context. Useful for maintaining persistent sessions. See Persistent Browser [31] for more details.
Copy

---

For more information about how browser context works, refer to the .
You can reuse the same context for multiple agents. If you do nothing, the browser will be automatically created and closed on completion.
​ [32]
Running the Agent
The agent is executed using the async method:
 (default: ) Maximum number of steps the agent can take during execution. This prevents infinite loops and helps control execution time.

---

​ [33]
Agent History
The method returns an object containing the complete execution history. This history is invaluable for debugging, analysis, and creating reproducible scripts.
Copy

---

The provides many helper methods to analyze the execution:
 : Get the final extracted content
 : Check if the agent completed successfully
 : Check if any errors occurred
 : Get the agent’s reasoning process
 : Get results of all actions

---

For a complete list of helper methods and detailed history analysis capabilities, refer to the .
​ [34]
Run initial actions without LLM
With you can run initial actions without the LLM. Specify the action as a dictionary where the key is the action name and the value is the action parameters. You can find all our actions in the source code.
Copy

---

​ [35]
Run with planner model
You can configure the agent to use a separate planner model for high-level task planning:
Copy

---

​ [36]
Planner Parameters
 : A LangChain chat model instance used for high-level task planning. Can be a smaller/cheaper model than the main LLM.
 : Enable/disable vision capabilities for the planner model. Defaults to .
 : Number of steps between planning phases. Defaults to .

---

Using a separate planner model can help:
 Reduce costs by using a smaller model for high-level planning
 Improve task decomposition and strategic thinking
 Better handle complex, multi-step tasks

---

The planner model is optional. If not specified, the agent will not use the planner model.
