Handling Sensitive Data
When working with sensitive information like passwords, you can use the parameter to prevent the model from seeing the actual values while still allowing it to reference them in its actions.
Here’s an example of how to use sensitive data:
Copy

---

In this example:
• The model only sees and as placeholders.
• When the model wants to use your password it outputs x_password - and we replace it with the actual value.
• When your password is visable on the current page, we replace it in the LLM input - so that the model never has it in its state.

---

Warning: Vision models still see the image of the page - where the sensitive data might be visible.
This approach ensures that sensitive information remains secure while still allowing the agent to perform tasks that require authentication.
