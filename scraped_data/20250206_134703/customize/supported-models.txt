Overview
Browser Use supports various LangChain chat models. Here’s how to configure and use the most popular ones. The full list is available in the .
​ [20]
Model Recommendations
We have yet to test performance across all models. Currently, we achieve the best results using GPT-4o with an 89% accuracy on the WebVoyager Dataset [21]. DeepSeek-V3 is 30 times cheaper than GPT-4o. Gemini-2.0-exp is also gaining popularity in the community because it is currently free. We also support local models, like Qwen 2.5, but be aware that small models often return the wrong output structure-which lead to parsing errors. We believe that local models will improve significantly this year.
All models require their respective API keys. Make sure to set them in your environment variables before running the agent.
